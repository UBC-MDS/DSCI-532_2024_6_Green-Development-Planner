## üëÄ The Challenge

One of the world's pressing challenges is achieving equal access to renewable energy in developing nations, a key to sustainable development and economic prosperity. Addressing this issue requires strategic resource allocation, which requires a deep understanding of each nation's energy needs and renewable capacity. By targeting areas where financial support of green energy projects yields the most impact, we can guide efforts and investments to foster development, equity, and environmental conservation.

## üí° Our vision

We have developed a dashboard to illuminate these critical insights for decision-makers and funding bodies. Our dashboard highlights where resources can make the most significant impact. By providing a clear global overview of energy consumption, potential for renewables, current investment flows, and country's GDP, we empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. Our ultimate goal is to facilitate the global transition to renewable energy, a key step towards global equity and sustainability.

## üìö A Quick Overview

Our dashboard offers a high-level overview of renewable energy metrics across the globe. The interactive world map enables users to select and visualize data spanning 20 years, featuring six key indicators: the percentage of renewable energy in total energy consumption, electricity access rates (% of population), financial investments in clean energy projects, and electricity generation breakdown by sources (i.e., fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables) for each country. A time slider allows for a historical perspective on these indicators.

On the right, the dashboard provides a country-specific analysis with two pie charts, two bar charts and one line chart. The pie charts display the average share of renewable energy and the electricity generation mix over the last five years. The bar charts compares a country's electricity access and financial flow for clean energy against the world average, again over the last five years. By using the average data of a latest five-year period, we ensure that the information captures the most recent situations, offering users an up-to-date, actionable snapshot of energy development. The line chart show the country's GPD per capita over a period of 20 years.

## üìñ Developer's Guide

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2024_6_Green-Development-Planner.git
```

### Step 2: Create the virtual environment

Create a new Conda environment using the `environment.yml` file provided in this repository. This file contains all the necessary dependencies.

To create the environment, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the `environment.yml` file is located. Then, run the following command:

``` bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate green-development-planner
```

### Step 3: Configure the Application for Development

For development purpose, set `debug=True` in file `src/app.py`.

``` bash
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

### Step 4: Change the path for reading data

Navigate into `src/data/data.py` and comment the section under `# For deployment on render`.

``` python
raw_data = pd.read_csv("../data/raw/global_data_sustainable_energy.csv")
processed_data = pd.read_csv("../data/preprocessed/processed_data.csv")
world = gpd.read_file("../data/preprocessed/world.shp")
gdf = gpd.read_file("../data/preprocessed/preprocessed_data.shp", geometry="geometry")
```

Then uncomment the section under `# For development on local machine`.
```python
# raw_data = pd.read_csv("data/raw/global_data_sustainable_energy.csv")
# processed_data = pd.read_csv("data/preprocessed/processed_data.csv")
# world = gpd.read_file("data/preprocessed/world.shp")
# gdf = gpd.read_file("data/preprocessed/preprocessed_data.shp", geometry="geometry")
```

Note: Before deployment on render.com, remember to reverse this step (comment the development section and uncomment the deployment section).

### Step 5: Run the dashboard

Navigate to the project root directory and use the following command.

``` bash
$ python ./src/app.py
```
