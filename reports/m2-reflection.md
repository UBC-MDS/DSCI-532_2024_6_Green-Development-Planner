# Milestone 2 Reflection

In this milestone we focused on implementing some basic version for each of the planned charts and drop downs, without getting too much into the aesthetic arrangements. We’ve been successful in that goal, so although the dashboard doesn’t look particularly polished yet, it does in fact have all the elements planned in our proposal. 

What’s left is quite a bit of work to improve the overall layout, as well as choosing a better colour scheme and map projection. The current choice of two pie charts and two bar charts is also mostly a temporary measure while we focus on the larger structure of the dashboard; it’s possible that we will decide to present the same data with different chart types in the future.

We’ve actually expanded a little on what was originally planned. In the global map on the left side of the dashboard we’ve introduced a slider to allow the user to select which year to display data from, a refinement on the original plan to present just a five-year average of the data. 

Currently the right side of the dashboard does a good job of summarizing the energy situation of a single country. However, it seems natural that the end user would appreciate being able to select multiple countries at a time to see in a single view how the different metrics compare. We didn’t have time to explore this possibility this week, but we plan to introduce this new functionality next week to further improve the dashboard’s utility.
