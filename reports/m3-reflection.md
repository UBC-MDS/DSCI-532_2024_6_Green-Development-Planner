# Milestone 3 Reflection

Since Milestone 1, we have made significant improvements to our Green Development Planning Dashboard. Each improvement was carefully designed to enhance the user experience while staying true to our environmental and energy themes.

## Enhancements in Dashboard

### 1. Color Scheme 
Overall, we completely changed the dashboard's color scheme. We moved away from the default palette to adopt colors that reflect environmental consciousness, with green as the main color. This choice extends to all charts, reinforcing the sustainability theme of the entire dashboard.

### 2. Map Projection
We switched from the traditional Mercator projection to the WGS84 projection, which more accurately represents geographic areas. This provides a more realistic global data visualization and addresses map distortion issues.

### 3. Interactive Maps
Enhanced features include a hover effect that better displays data for countries/regions within the active area, helping us focus on specific areas. These interactive elements create a seamless experience as users explore different regions.

### 4. Map Refinement
We adjusted the color scale to below the map.

### 5. Visualization of GDP and Population Data
We switched from line charts to a card layout, which presents key data in an easier-to-understand format. This not only improves the readability of the data but also ensures that critical statistics are prominently placed for quick reference.

### 6. Chart Refinement
We refined the text in the dashboard by changing the title to "Energy Consumption" on the left donut chart, making the text more precise. We removed three dots actions enhancement, making the chart look more aesthetically pleasing and simple.

### 7. Codebase Optimization
We reorganized our application by breaking the code into multiple files. This not only improved the manageability of the code but also paved the way for future updates and potential scalability.

## Limitations and Future Directions
While our dashboard is now more user-friendly and informative, we recognize its limitations. The current data representation, though improved, still needs further refinement for quicker understanding. Future potential improvements include implementing more refined data filters and integrating predictive analytics to forecast trends in green development.
