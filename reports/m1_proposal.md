# Research Question  

Mary is a policy advisor focusing on enhancing energy access and promoting renewable energy initiatives globally. Mary's role involves identifying countries / regions where the funding and resources can significantly boost their transition towards sustainable energy, particularly in areas lagging behind in electricity access and clean energy.  

Mary aims to prioritize funding to countries that are most in need of clean energy infrastructure. She also aims for a decision-making process that is evidence-based and transparent, in order to foster trust and clarity among stakeholders.  

When Mary accesses the dashboard, she can view a world map where each country is shaded in a color that corresponds to its specific value for a chosen variable, such as 'Electricity from fossil fuels'. Additionally, the dashboard offers interactive tools that enable Mary to delve into the detailed statistics of a particular country, examining aspects such as the country's access to electricity, gaps between fossil fuel and renewable energy use (hereafter 'energy gaps'), overall scale of energy production and consumption, and financial aid received.   

Specifically, Mary's task involves a few steps. First, she will look for countries with a low level of electricity access, as these countries have the greatest need for energy. Then, she will examine their energy gaps, overall scale of energy usage, and the financial aid they received. This process allows Mary to identify countries / regions that, despite significant energy gaps and limited access to electricity, have not received enough renewable energy funds.    

The dashboard enables Mary to make an informed decision. It will facilitate a funding allocation strategy that prioritizes countries with the greatest need and potential for energy usage change. Our dashboard ensures that the funding project effectively reduces global reliance on fossil fuels, boost clean energy, and promotes sustainable development in unfunded countries / regions.
