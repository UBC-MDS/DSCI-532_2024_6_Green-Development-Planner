# Motivation and Purpose
Role: Renewable Energy Development Advisory

Target Audience: Policymakers and Funding Organizations

Our initiative is centered on the pivotal goal of enhancing renewable energy infrastructures in developing countries, where the need for sustainable and accessible energy solutions is most critical. With limited resources for such significant aid funds, the challenge lies in identifying and prioritizing funding opportunities that promise the highest impact on sustainable development and energy access.

Our proposed data visualization dashboard is designed to streamline this decision-making process. It will enable policymakers and funding organizations to identify and prioritize aid funds in renewable energy with the highest potential for impact. By aggregating and visualizing key data on energy access, current energy mix, and renewable potential, the dashboard provides a clear, data-driven basis for directing funds.

This tool aims to ensure efficient and equitable use of resources, supporting a transition to sustainable energy in underserved regions. This focused approach aims to facilitate informed decisions, helping to accelerate global efforts towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.
