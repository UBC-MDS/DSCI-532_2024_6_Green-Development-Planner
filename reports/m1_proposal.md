![An artist's rendition of the dashboard](image.png)

The Green Development Planner dashboard fits into a single screen view. Since the data consists of a variety of metrics recorded for a variety of countries, there are two main viewpoints to consider: either a single metric across multiple countries, or multiple metrics corresponding to a single country. The dashboard is accordingly split left and right according to these two main viewpoints. On the left there is a world political map that acts as a heat map for one metric at time, with the shading of a country indicating the metric value for that country. The metric under consideration can be selected from a menu at the bottom. On the right there is a collection of graphs illustrating metrics from a single country. The country under consideration can can be changed using a drop down menu.
