# Motivation and Purpose
Role: Renewable Energy Development Advisory

Target Audience: Policymakers and Funding Organizations

Our initiative is centered on the pivotal goal of enhancing renewable energy infrastructures in developing countries, where the need for sustainable and accessible energy solutions is most critical. With limited resources for such significant aid funds, the challenge lies in identifying and prioritizing funding opportunities that promise the highest impact on sustainable development and energy access.

Our proposed data visualization dashboard is designed to streamline this decision-making process. It will enable policymakers and funding organizations to identify and prioritize aid funds in renewable energy with the highest potential for impact. By aggregating and visualizing key data on energy access, current energy mix, and renewable potential, the dashboard provides a clear, data-driven basis for directing funds.

This tool aims to ensure efficient and equitable use of resources, supporting a transition to sustainable energy in underserved regions. This focused approach aims to facilitate informed decisions, helping to accelerate global efforts towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

# Description and Data

# Research Question  

Mary is a policy advisor focusing on enhancing energy access and promoting renewable energy initiatives globally. Mary's role involves identifying countries / regions where the funding and resources can significantly boost their transition towards sustainable energy, particularly in areas lagging behind in electricity access and clean energy.  

Mary aims to prioritize funding to countries that are most in need of clean energy infrastructure. She also aims for a decision-making process that is evidence-based and transparent, in order to foster trust and clarity among stakeholders.  

When Mary accesses the dashboard, she can view a world map where each country is shaded in a color that corresponds to its specific value for a chosen variable, such as 'Electricity from fossil fuels'. Additionally, the dashboard offers interactive tools that enable Mary to delve into the detailed statistics of a particular country, examining aspects such as the country's access to electricity, gaps between fossil fuel and renewable energy use (hereafter 'energy gaps'), overall scale of energy production and consumption, and financial aid received.   

Specifically, Mary's task involves a few steps. First, she will look for countries with a low level of electricity access, as these countries have the greatest need for energy. Then, she will examine their energy gaps, overall scale of energy usage, and the financial aid they received. This process allows Mary to identify countries / regions that, despite significant energy gaps and limited access to electricity, have not received enough renewable energy funds.    

The dashboard enables Mary to make an informed decision. It will facilitate a funding allocation strategy that prioritizes countries with the greatest need and potential for energy usage change. Our dashboard ensures that the funding project effectively reduces global reliance on fossil fuels, boost clean energy, and promotes sustainable development in unfunded countries / regions.
