## Adjustments on Dashboard
### Data Manipulation

By using binary files to load data, the dashboard is now more efficient and provides faster access to data. This greatly improves user engagement by reducing wait times.

### Dashboard Layout

We added a second card with a subtitle and removed text from the footer. We adjusted the width of the title banner and made it more seamless with the rest of the dashboard. These changes not only improve the visual appeal, but also help communicate information more clearly. This ensures that users can easily understand and navigate the dashboard.

### Arc Charts

We introduced percentage data in the tooltip displays and adjusted the color schemes to eliminate confusion between similar-looking categories such as "Fossil Fuels" and "Other." This adjustment provides a clearer presentation of the data, ensuring that users can distinguish between different data sets without misinterpretation.

### Bar Charts

Removing redundant labels such as "Country" on the y-axis and implementing a custom sort order in bar charts makes the data presentation cleaner and more focused. It directs the audience's attention to the most important information. This improves understanding and interaction with the data displayed.

### GDP Cards and World Map

Simplifying numerical data displayed on the GDP cards by removing two decimal places makes the figures easier to read and interpret. We adjusted the color scheme on the world map; they now better represent different metrics contextually, such as not using dark green to indicate higher fossil fuel usage, which conceptually conflicts with common color usage norms in data representation.

## Reflections

We found the peer review process to be exceptionally beneficial. Although we did not have access to real user feedback as it is a school project, the constructive criticism and suggestions from classmates during the peer reviews effectively simulated actual user insights. This peer feedback was instrumental in iterating and refining the dashboard design, mimicking a real-world feedback loop that is critical for product development. The peer feedbacks helped identify specific areas for improvement which we addressed in subsequent revisions.

Additionally, exploring various dashboard galleries and examples provided much inspiration and practical guidance. These resources showcased different approaches to dashboard aesthetics and functionality, offering insights into how effectively data can be visualized to enhance user understanding and engagement. The examples also demonstrated best practices in design and interaction patterns which were crucial in shaping the modifications we applied to our dashboard.

## Limitations

The dashboard lacks the capability for direct comparison across different countries or regions, which would be a significant addition for future iterations. Enabling users to select and compare multiple countries simultaneously could provide valuable insights into regional trends and help identify areas for targeted green development. If there were more time, adding this comparative functionality would be a key improvement to bolster the dashboard's analytical depth.
